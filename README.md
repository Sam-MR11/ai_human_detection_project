# 🤖 AI vs Human Text Detection

A machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit to detect whether text was written by a human or generated by an AI (e.g., ChatGPT). Upload `.txt`, `.docx`, or `.pdf` files, or type text directly. Choose a classification model (SVM, Decision Tree, AdaBoost), and receive real-time predictions with confidence scores and visual explanations.

## 🔧 Installation Instructions

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sam120-ass/ai_human_detection_project.git
cd ai_human_detection_project
```

#### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv        #"venv venv" or 'create a folder': Eg: python -m venv project1 (Creates a project1 folder)
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open VS Code/IDE

### Running the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a local web server where you can:

- Upload text files (.txt, .docx, .pdf)
- Choose from the 3 classifiers (SVM, Decision Tree, AdaBoost)
- View AI vs Human predictions with confidence scores
- See visualizations and model comparison
- Download prediction reports

### Machine Learning Models

All models were trained using optimized parameters with GridSearchCV and evaluated using 5-fold stratified cross-validation.
```
Model	                  Accuracy	                Features Used	          Notes
SVM		                      >90%              TF-IDF(10,000 ngrams)       Best overall performance
Decision Tree			      ~75%                      TF-IDF (2000)       Fast and interpretable
AdaBoost			          ~82%                      TF-IDF (2000)       Robust to noise, ensemble-based
```
The models and the vectorizer are saved in the models/ folder using joblib.

### 📊 Visualisations Included 

    - Prediction probability bars

    - Model agreement/disagreement summary

    - Word frequency cloud

    - Feature importance (for tree-based models)

    - Word count/sentence length stats

### 📁 Models Directory (/models)

Ensure these files are present in the /models folder before running the app:

    - Human_Vs_AI_Written_pipeline.pkl
    - decision_tree_pipeline.pkl
    - adaboost_pipeline.pkl
    - tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

### 📋 Report and Evaluation Highlights
    
    - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score reported

    - Confusion matrices & ROC curves plotted for all models

    - Agreement rates between models calculated and visualized

    - Final model selected based on best cross-validation and holdout performance

### 🧪 Testing Files

Located in sample_files/:
    
    - AI Generated.txt

    - Human-Written.docx

    - AI Generated.pdf

Use these for demo and testing the app UI.

### 🛠 Design Decisions & Notes

🧩 Used Pipeline() to combine preprocessing, TF-IDF, and classifier into one object

✅ Ensured consistency by not mixing custom and pipeline preprocessing

🧪 All models were trained using the same TF-IDF vectorizer (2000/10000 features depending on model)

📁 Saved modular models for better control and debugging


### 📽 Demo Video (to be added)

A demo video is added here showing:

  - Model selection and predictions

  - Uploading PDF/Word/Text documents

  - Agreement analysis and downloading reports
